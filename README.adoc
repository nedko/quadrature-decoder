[NOTE]
This is Work In Progress

Quadrature decoder for use with a rotary (A&B wires type) encoder.

Features:

 * Clock-less operation. That is, no clocks, even within the chips.
   This is a good for audio prosumer and hi-fi uses,
   or any other uses where noise emission is to be kept low,
   e.g. Frequency knob of HAM radio VFO.
 * Analog output (at least 12bit - 4096 steps) *slow* analog DAC,
   via covox-style resistor network.
 * Relatively cheap to build.

As stated in the top note, the project is Work In Progress.
That is, there is no physically built prototype yet.

The clock-less operation also means asynchronous operation of the
logic. That is, a finite state automatas are have their state
transitioned at clock ticks that are part of the input. In this case,
the clock input is the rotary encoder itself. When rotary encoder does
not move, no logic switches will occur. The aimed design is with DIP
packaged CMOS logic chips from CD40XX series, as they are (currently
and fortunately) relatively cheap and easy to assemble in small volumes
by human with some soldering skills. PCBs of an SMD design variant of
the same schematics are usually populated by specialized machines, but
with some skill the PCB can be populated with manually by humans too.

Tools:

 * KiCAD - schematics and PCB design
